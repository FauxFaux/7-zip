How to compile
--------------
To compile sources you need Visual C++ 6.0.
For compiling some files you also need 
new Platform SDK from Microsoft' Site:
http://www.microsoft.com/msdownload/platformsdk/sdkupdate/psdk-full.htm
or
http://www.microsoft.com/msdownload/platformsdk/sdkupdate/


Notes:
------
7-Zip consists of COM modules (DLL files).
But 7-Zip doesn't use standard COM interfaces for creating objects.
Look at
7zip\UI\Client7z folder for example of using DLL files of 7-Zip. 
Some DLL files can use other DLL files from 7-Zip.
If you don't like it, you must use standalone version of DLL.
To compile standalone version of DLL you must include all used parts
to project and define some defs. 
For example, 7zip\Bundles\Format7z is a standalone version  of 7z.dll 
that works with 7z format. So you can use such DLL in your project 
without additional DLL files.
